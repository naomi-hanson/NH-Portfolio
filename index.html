                  <p class="about-description about-big">“Far from home dwelt a wanderer looking for a spark of light…”</p>
              <p class="about-description">
                Hi, my name’s Naomi and in one sense I was looking for a spark of light. I started off as an animation student who focused on how to light scenes. Light and color has held my fascination for a long time because it’s a hidden storyteller. These inseparable elements help to draw the audience into a story they may be watching, heightening dramatic moments, setting the atmosphere, all to get the audience emotionally involved. When I started doing design for my church, I found that the process of designing was much like telling a story. In design you may get only one glimpse to tell your story to the audience, but still a story is told. What is the value of this company? How might this new app make my life easier? Does this company care about children? All of these are stories that are conveyed through visual design, why I’ve been drawn into design myself.
                <br><br>
                Once I started focusing on design I became a student at Bloc in order to make the gear shift into ui/ux design from animation. It’s been a rewarding experience as I’ve been equipped with a new set of storytelling tools. I’ve learned how, much like lighting is icing on the cake for an animated film, visual design is the icing for good UX design. One has to “write the script,” to make an analogy using animation, before you “design characters and settings.” And much like animation, the way I interpret a design and how other people interpret a design will be much different. So I’ve learned to value research and take time to figure out how other people view life, and apply that to designs I’m working on.
                <br><br>
                  Along the same lines of storytelling, I also create illustrations, particularly focusing on children’s picture books, enjoying the whimsy and imagination needed to tell a young child a story that will captivate them and help them to navigate through life. On the side I dabble in photography, videography, animation, and writing for fun, to grow and express myself in different creative ways. I also consider myself a green thumb, though my plants may disagree, and an amateur film critic.</p>
                  <br>
                <p class="about-description about-big">Since I love storytelling so much, here’s quotes by my two favorite authors.</p>
                <p class="about-description">“The value of the myth is that it takes all the things we know and restores to them the rich significance which has been hidden by ‘the veil of familiarity.’ The child enjoys his cold meat, otherwise dull to him, by pretending it is buffalo, just killed with his own bow and arrow. And the child is wise. The real meat comes back to him more savory for having been dipped in a story…By putting bread, gold, horse, apple, or the very roads into a myth, we do not retreat from reality: we rediscover it.” 
                    <br>― <span class="authors">C.S. Lewis</span>, <i>On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature</i>
                <br><br>
                “It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.” 
                <br>― <span class="authors">J.R.R. Tolkien</span>, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i></p>

                        <p class="solution-description">The design was inspired by the cafes in the surrounding area that the target audience was familiar with as well as having coffee related colors to reflect the app’s focus. There were several features based on the research that other search sites, such as Yelp, didn’t display. Features that were important to the target audience’s needs have been incorporated on a cafe’s page for quick access.

              <h4 class="overlay-titles">Process</h4>
              <p class="remodal-description">Originally, the goal of the project was to design an app to find food trucks. During the initial research for this app I discovered that people rarely, if ever, searched for food trucks. It just wasn’t something they were interested in. As a result I switched gears and started focusing on cafes, as I had noticed that cafes were among the top searched for food places. After switching the focus of the app I did another round of research and found that users had specific needs when searching for cafes. Since the target audience was made up of college students, they typically went to cafes to study, meaning some of the features they looked for in a cafe were amount of seating, number of outlets, and surprisingly, ambience. These features aren’t a part of leading competitor’s designs, such as Yelp, making it more difficult for users to find what they may be looking for in a cafe. Thus I decided these user specified features needed to be used in the final design.</p>

          <section class="process">
            <p class="remodal-description">After the research I mapped out the user stories and flows, I found that what the user research showed is that users wanted to be shown a ton of information, in particular different features that would need to be displayed on a single page. Since this was for mobile, it was a matter of how to organize and maybe split different information between multiple pages. I also did research into other mobile apps, such as Yelp and Airbnb, to see how they were able to accomplish their layouts. From there I was able to sketch out different layouts of necessary pages and design a working solution.

          <section class="process">
            <p class="remodal-description">Afterwards I did some user testing and found a problem with the how I was designing the filter inputs for the map and list layouts. For the filters, to make it as easy as possible for the user to use the app without an overwhelming amount of text, I started creating icons that could be readable at extremely small sizes. But when I started doing user tests, the testers were confused at what the icons represented, such as the case for the “Amount of Seating”. The testers were confused, able to register that the icon was a chair, but unsure if it meant how much seating they wanted to reserve, or was available at that precise moment. It was a case where instead of icons I needed to use words in order to accurately convey what the filter would do.

              <p class="remodal-description">Another issue I ran into was the app branding. I needed to design a logo that conveyed the goal of the app as well as reflect the aesthetics that typically appealed to the target users. I went through many variations, looking up classic cafe logos to gain inspiration and to harken to the purpose of the app. These logos were typically more complex and detailed, which looked great. However, I found that when these logos were shrunk to be used as the app’s button logo, these complex designs simply did not work and became nothing more than fuzzy blobs at these smaller sizes. So I started going for simpler shapes to represent the app.</p>

          <section class="process">
              <p class="remodal-description">I started taking inspiration from the location of my target audience in the San Francisco Bay Area, began trying to incorporate the Golden Gate Bridge into the logo. Most of the designs still appeared too complex to be able to read properly at smaller sizes. Eventually I started settling for the coffee bean shape, as it was simple and recognizable. Through some extra research I saw that the coffee bean wasn’t used as much as I thought it would be as a standalone logo. But it was for good reason. After bouncing ideas off of a fellow designer, we came to the conclusion that the coffee bean by itself was plain, and generic, not really able to stand out on it’s own from the many different apps out there.</p>

              <p class="remodal-description">I went through more iterations of the coffee bean, changing how it was drawn in order to make it more unique. Then I tried combining my earlier idea of using the Golden Gate Bridge with the coffee bean. It added uniqueness to help the logo stand out, worked at smaller sizes, and was still recognizable as a coffee bean according to a user test. After a few more tweaks this iteration became the current logo.

            <p class="remodal-description">Overall, this was a good learning experience. One of the biggest lessons I learned is that what I perceive and what the user perceives is completely different and thus the importance of careful research and testing in   order to create a user-friendly design. The research drove a lot of the important decisions I made including refocusing the project onto being a cafe finder. Through research I added filters that helped accomplish the user’s goals of finding cafe specific features for their needs. The logo was also able to convey to the users from the beginning the goals of the app. 
            <br><br>On the other hand I think sections like the cafe’s menu needed more time and attention paid to it. The drop down sections in the menu, make for a messy and slow process for users to find what they’re looking for. The next time I would make it one long menu made into sections with bold headings.

                        <p class="solution-description">The design was inspired by the cafes in the surrounding area that the target audience was familiar with as well as having coffee related colors to reflect the app’s focus. There were several features based on the research that other search sites, such as Yelp, didn’t display. Features that were important to the target audience’s needs have been incorporated on a cafe’s page for quick access.

              <p class="remodal-description">Originally, the goal of the project was to design an app to find food trucks. During the initial research for this app I discovered that people rarely, if ever, searched for food trucks. It just wasn’t something they were interested in. As a result I switched gears and started focusing on cafes, as I had noticed that cafes were among the top searched for food places. After switching the focus of the app I did another round of research and found that users had specific needs when searching for cafes. Since the target audience was made up of college students, they typically went to cafes to study, meaning some of the features they looked for in a cafe were amount of seating, number of outlets, and surprisingly, ambience. These features aren’t a part of leading competitor’s designs, such as Yelp, making it more difficult for users to find what they may be looking for in a cafe. Thus I decided these user specified features needed to be used in the final design.</p>

          <section class="process">
            <p class="remodal-description">After the research I mapped out the user stories and flows, I found that what the user research showed is that users wanted to be shown a ton of information, in particular different features that would need to be displayed on a single page. Since this was for mobile, it was a matter of how to organize and maybe split different information between multiple pages. I also did research into other mobile apps, such as Yelp and Airbnb, to see how they were able to accomplish their layouts. From there I was able to sketch out different layouts of necessary pages and design a working solution.

          <section class="process">
            <p class="remodal-description">Afterwards I did some user testing and found a problem with the how I was designing the filter inputs for the map and list layouts. For the filters, to make it as easy as possible for the user to use the app without an overwhelming amount of text, I started creating icons that could be readable at extremely small sizes. But when I started doing user tests, the testers were confused at what the icons represented, such as the case for the “Amount of Seating”. The testers were confused, able to register that the icon was a chair, but unsure if it meant how much seating they wanted to reserve, or was available at that precise moment. It was a case where instead of icons I needed to use words in order to accurately convey what the filter would do.

              <p class="remodal-description">Another issue I ran into was the app branding. I needed to design a logo that conveyed the goal of the app as well as reflect the aesthetics that typically appealed to the target users. I went through many variations, looking up classic cafe logos to gain inspiration and to harken to the purpose of the app. These logos were typically more complex and detailed, which looked great. However, I found that when these logos were shrunk to be used as the app’s button logo, these complex designs simply did not work and became nothing more than fuzzy blobs at these smaller sizes. So I started going for simpler shapes to represent the app.</p>

          <section class="process">
              <p class="remodal-description">I started taking inspiration from the location of my target audience in the San Francisco Bay Area, began trying to incorporate the Golden Gate Bridge into the logo. Most of the designs still appeared too complex to be able to read properly at smaller sizes. Eventually I started settling for the coffee bean shape, as it was simple and recognizable. Through some extra research I saw that the coffee bean wasn’t used as much as I thought it would be as a standalone logo. But it was for good reason. After bouncing ideas off of a fellow designer, we came to the conclusion that the coffee bean by itself was plain, and generic, not really able to stand out on it’s own from the many different apps out there.</p>
